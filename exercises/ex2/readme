a file contains 

one hello mate. how are you?
I'm fine mate. how are you? two
one hello mate. how are you? line3
This line contains three and hence shouldn't be deleted.


Write a sed program to delete a line if it started with one and the following line ended with two and 
delete the first word "one" if the following line didn't end with two.
